A new step has been added to get MongoDB installed and running on c9, before you run the 3 commands from the following video lecture, you'll first need to run 

sudo apt-get install -y mongodb-org 

from your terminal in c9.

Further instructions can be found here.

Meanwhile, after you're up and running with mongo, be sure to shut down your mongod server each time you're done working. You can do this with ctrl + c 

If you leave it running then Cloud 9 could timeout and cause mongo to crash. If this happens, try the following steps to repair it. 

From the command line, run:

cd ~
./mongod --repair

If you're still having trouble getting it to run then find the /data directory (it should be inside of ~ or ~/workspace) and cd into it. Once inside, run rm mongod.lock then cd back into ~ and run ./mongod again (see below).

cd ~/data
rm mongod.lock
cd
./mongod
